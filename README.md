# Interpretable Latent Spaces in GANs Using Space-Filling Vector Quantization

This repository contains a demo to test and compare interpretable directions found by our proposed method, GANSpace, and LatentCLR methods in intermediate latent space (W) of StyleGAN2 pretrained on FFHQ dataset. The paper is submitted to ECCV 2024.

Plase download the StyleGAN2 pretrained model named "stylegan2-ffhq-1024x1024.pkl" from NVIDIA website under [this link.](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/research/models/stylegan2/files)
